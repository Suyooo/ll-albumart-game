This is a modified version of the autocompleter module based off of commit `baba200a`.  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/autocompleter  
https://github.com/kraaden/autocomplete

Changes include:
- Accessibility improvements (also submitted in PR #96)
- Always use `input` event instead of `keyup` event to update suggestions, so IMEs work correctly
- Removing some deprecated properties/types to avoid hints polluting svelte-check output
